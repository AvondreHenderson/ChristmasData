# Christmas Data: An illustration of the ETL process (Extract, Transform, & Load)

## The preface of this project was to find several datasets and explain how we extracted the data, transformed and cleaned it, and loaded it into a SQL Database.
## Our group decided to find data centering around the Holiday season pertaining to Movies, Recipes, Music, and Holiday Shopping. <br><br>

* The Folder "Christmas Pictures" contains all of the photos that were used in the powerpoint presentation.
* The Folder "JupyterNotebooks" contains all of the Jupyter Notebooks that were used to perform the ETL operations.
* The Folder "SQLdatatables" contains the SQL data files.
