# Christmas Data: Project 2 - Extract, Transform, Load

## The preface of this project was to find several datasets and explain how we extracted the data, transformed it into a data frame using different cleaning methods, and loaded it into a SQL Database. <br>
## Our group decided to find data centering around the Holiday season pertaining to Movies, Recipes, Music, and Holiday Shopping. <br>

* The Folder "Christmas Pictures" contains all of the photos that were used in the powerpoint presentation.
* The Folder "JupyterNotebooks" contains all of the Jupyter Notebooks that were used to perform the ETL operations.
* The Folder "SQLdatatables" contains the SQL data files.
