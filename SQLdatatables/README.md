# Christmas Data: Project 2 - Extract, Transform, Load

### The preface of this project was to find several datasets and explain how we extracted the data, transformed it into a data frame using different cleaning methods, and loaded it into a SQL Database. 
### Our group decided to find data centering around the Holiday season pertaining to Movies, Recipes, Music, and Holiday Shopping. 



* "recipes.ipynb" is the notebook for importing the recipe data file into PostgreSQL.
* "recipes.json" is the data file containing the christmas recipes.
* "recipes.json" needs to remain in the same directory as "recipes.ipynb".
* "movies.ipynb" is the notebook for pulling Christmas movies from OMDB and putting into PostgreSQL.
* "config.py" must contain the user's OMDB api key for "movies.ipynb" to operate.
* "config.py" must be present in the same directory as "movies.ipynb".
* "ChristmasDB.sql" is a backup PostgreSQL file containing the final recipes and movies tables.
* SalesData_Michael.ipynb is the notebook pulling all of the Holiday Shopping data. 
* "Christmas Music" contains the database for all of the Christmas Music. 
* The "Resources" folder contains the csv files for the toy sales and music notebook


#### The Folder "Christmas Pictures" contains all of the photos that were used in the powerpoint presentation
